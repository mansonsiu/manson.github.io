Proud to make this public today. Created a tool to generate custom QRCode online. The good stuff is, you will need no coding at the consuming side, not even Javascript. This makes use of SVG, all you need to do is to place the right HTML tag into your page, and this good to go.


Try it out and generate your custom QRCode here:
